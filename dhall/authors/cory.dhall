    , summary = "I am an experienced Cloud Engineer, Architect, and Systems Engineer with a pragmatic, problem-solving mindset and a strong belief in using the right tool for the job—whether in software, infrastructure, or process design. I have strong opinions but hold them weakly, always open to new ideas and better ways of doing things. I believe that most problems stem from miscommunication rather than pure engineering challenges, and I prioritize clarity and collaboration to prevent that. My experience spans cloud architecture, infrastructure automation, and low-level systems engineering. I enjoy building reliable, scalable systems and refining workflows to enhance efficiency. Learning is a lifelong pursuit of mine—I thrive on exploring new technologies, understanding how things work under the hood, and continuously improving both my craft and the environments I work in."
