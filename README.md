# Resume Builder

A modern, type-safe resume builder that uses Dhall for configuration and generates both a LaTeX PDF resume and a React website.

## Architecture

This project uses a unique architecture that combines several powerful technologies:

### Dhall Configuration
- Uses Dhall as a higher-order abstraction layer for type-safe configuration
- Defines strongly-typed schemas for resume data, including:
  - Job history
  - Skills and buzzwords
  - Contact information
  - Notable contributions
- Generates both LaTeX and JSON outputs from a single source of truth

### Build System
- Uses Nix Flakes for reproducible development environments
- Provides a consistent build environment across different machines
- Includes all necessary dependencies:
  - Dhall and Dhall-json for configuration processing
  - LaTeX with required packages for PDF generation
  - Node.js and npm for website development
  - Development tools (git, gh, etc.)

### Output Formats
1. **LaTeX Resume**
   - Generates a professional PDF resume
   - Uses a custom LaTeX template
   - Build with: `nix build .#resume`

2. **React Website**
   - Modern web interface built with Vite + React
   - Uses the same Dhall configuration
   - Features a responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Includes interactive components from shadcn/ui

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Nix package manager
- Git

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Enter the development shell:
   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```
3. Start the development server:

### Building
- Generate the resume PDF:

  ```

## CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflows for:
  - Building and releasing resume PDFs on tags
  - Building and deploying the website from rendered JSON payload
  - Automated testing and validation
